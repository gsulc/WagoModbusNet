Typical pitfal:
    You dial with a WAGO ethernet controller. Try to set outputs - but nothing happens!
    WAGO ethernet controller provide a "owner" policy for physical outputs.
    The "owner" could be CoDeSys-Runtime or Fieldbus-Master.
    Every time you download a PLC program the CoDeSys-Runtime becomes "owner" of physical outputs.
    Use tool "Ethernet-Settings.exe" and "format" and "extract" filesystem is easiest way to assign Modbus-Master as "owner".
    Alternativly you can "Login" with CoDeSys-IDE and perform "Reset(original)".
